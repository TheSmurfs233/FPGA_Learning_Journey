INFO: [Labtools 27-2302] Device xc7a35t (JTAG device index = 0) is programmed with a design that has 1 ILA core(s).
WARNING: [Labtools 27-3413] Dropping logic core with cellname:'u_ila_1' at location 'uuid_3B505A030738513C98471D25F5B1F848' from probes file, since it cannot be found on the programmed device.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-3413] Dropping logic core with cellname:'u_ila_3' at location 'uuid_9C18410BB87B565386C9544CBA1F346F' from probes file, since it cannot be found on the programmed device.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-1973] Mismatch between the design programmed into the device xc7a35t (JTAG device index = 0) and the probes file(s) D:/FPGA_Learning_Journey/Pro/OV5640_DDR3_HDMI___/project/project_1.runs/impl_1/ddr3_test.ltx.
 The device core at location uuid_23E7D65A79BC59F7BC47406C1714DFAE, has 15 ILA Input port(s), but the core in the probes file(s) have 2 ILA Input port(s).
Resolution: 
1. Reprogram device with the correct programming file and associated probes file(s) OR
2. Goto device properties and associate the correct probes file(s) with the programming file already programmed in the device.
