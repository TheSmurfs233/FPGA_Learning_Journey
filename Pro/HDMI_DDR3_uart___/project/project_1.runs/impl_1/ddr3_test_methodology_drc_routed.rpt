Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCV-1#1 Advisory
Incomplete constraint coverage due to missing original object used in replication.  
The option '-from : [get_cells -hier *rstdiv0_sync_r1_reg*]' of the following constraint is attached to some replicated objects but not to the corresponding original object. Please review the missing original objects and assess if they need to be included in the constraint. Use 'get_cells or get_pins -include_replicated_objects <origObjectName>' to query all replicated objects associated with an original object.
